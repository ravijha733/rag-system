# Creating a Chatbot with Streamlit LangChain and OpenAI

Chat application that seamlessly integrates PDF interaction and the power of OpenAI's language model and LangChain. With this, you can engage in natural and intuitive conversations with PDF documents, making information retrieval, analysis, and collaboration easier than ever before.

## LANGCHAIN

LangChain serves as a foundational framework for crafting applications driven by language models. Our conviction lies in the idea that the most potent and distinctive applications won't merely invoke language models as external resources.

## Streamlit

Streamlit is a Python library available as open-source, designed to simplify the process of creating and distributing visually appealing custom web applications tailored for machine learning and data science purposes. With Streamlit, it takes just a matter of minutes to construct and launch robust data applications, allowing for swift and efficient development and deployment.
